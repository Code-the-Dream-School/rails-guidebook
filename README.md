## Overview 

**Learning Objective:** Students will be able to complete a series of practice SQL exercises. 

A practice SQL environment is at https://www.w3schools.com/sql/trysql.asp?filename=trysql_select_all

A series of exercises are described in sql.txt. Create a new git branch called sql-lesson. As you solve each exercise, paste the sql statement you used into sql.txt, and when you have completed all of them, push the result to github and issue a pull request.

You can click on each table in the right hand column to familiarize yourself with the schema of the database. As you solve each of the SQL tasks below, copy the SQL statement and paste it into sql.txt of your git repository using your editor. When you are done with the lesson, push the result to github and issue a pull request.

Note: It is not possible to do these exercises in Firefox. Use Chrome, or if you have a different browser, try it to see if it works.

### :thinking: Questions 

Use this time to answer students questions from the lesson materials and assignments. Remember to incorporate teaching strategies: 

  - **Think aloud**: Narrate your thinking to show students how developers approach problems. For example, “When I saw this problem, I decided to approach it by…”
  - Use **positive narration**. For example, “I appreciate that Raheem has his camera on today” or “That was an excellent question.” 
  - **Warm call** on students or practice **popcorn calling** (students can ask another student for help) if participation is low. 

### :telescope: Looking Ahead 

Next week, we'll get our first look at Ruby. Has anyone practiced with Ruby before? What are you most interested in learning about it? 

## Common Issues 

In the first mentor session, one of your main goals should be establishing rapport with students. Focus on creating a space where it's ok to ask for help or be wrong. Remind students that professional developers need to get help all the time.
