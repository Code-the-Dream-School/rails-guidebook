## Overview 

**Learning Objective:** 

- **3.1**: Students will be able to create a PR that has controllers, views, and models for pages and posts.
- **3.2**: Students will be able to create PRs for four separate repositories

Both lessons 3.1 and 3.2 use the same assignment repository, contained here. 
This repository contains the framework for the blog application students will develop as they go through the
Treehouse videos on Rails development. 

The blog application is modified in the Treehouse videos for Ruby on Rails 5 Basics and Rails Routes and
Resources.  When you complete Rails Routes and Resources, push your blog branch to github, create
a pull request, and submit your work using Squibby.

In assignment 3.2, students should submit one Squibby entry with links to all four pull requests.
