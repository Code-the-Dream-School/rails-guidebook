# README -- Code The Dream Lessons 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, and 4.4

After you clone the repository, create a new branch called validations, and put your work there.  When you complete the section on Additional Subjects,
push your validations branch to github and create a pull request.  Then create a new branch called rspec, for the section on Rails Testing with RSpec.
When you complete that section, push your work to github again, and create a pull request.  Then create a new branch called full-assignment, for the
class section on a complete assignment.  Once you finish that, you push the full-assignment branch to github and create another pull request.  Typically each
of these sections will be assigned in separate weeks.

This repository will be used again for the class section on Bootstrap in Rails, which is also
a separate week.
