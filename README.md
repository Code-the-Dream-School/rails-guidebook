## Overview 

**Learning Objective:** Students will be able to create a front end for the API. 

This week's repository contains an AJAX front-end application that calls the API provided by the Rails REST
application of the previous unit. Students should create a git branch called ajax, make their changes there,
and then when the lesson is complete, push it to github and issue a pull request.
